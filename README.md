As a user I want an app that allows me to collaborate on group events, from trips, to nights out, or office events. So that I can streamline the decision making/ brainstorming process with my colleagues and friends in an effortless way, and can keep everyone informed on what the current plans are in case something changes.

As it stands, planning causes a lot of debates back and forth. With this we can streamline the planning process, letting everyone vote on an event to do together.

Once we all agree on an event, what if those plans which we all made suddenly have to change? With this, we can keep everyone informed on what event is currently on, and what we all agree on as backups, etc.

While many devices have calendar apps, such as Google’s planning Calendars, this app focuses more on group planning, while most calendar apps simply boil down to “mark a date, send an email to notify everyone”, this focuses on the group planning aspect, letting everyone have a voice in the decision making, while also keeping people informed on the plans if they change.

## Installation

Our deployed app currently is web and browser based, and requires no downloads nor installation.


## Usage

Users can create an account and log into Likeminded where they have social groups with other users.

Within these groups they can propose events for the group to participate in, logging plans and keeping everyone in the group informed. Simply click "Vote" on the event within the group to let the group know your "yay" or "nay" opinion, and all users within the group are informed.
